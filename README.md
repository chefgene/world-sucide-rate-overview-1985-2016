# WORLD SUICIDE RATE

## world suicide-rate overview 1985-2016

few days ago, I stumbled on a dataset on Kaggle on suicide rates over 113 countries and I decided to conduct an analysis to identify the ways to address the issue of suicide rates by the analysis of my data.

Suicide is defined as the act of intentionally causing one’s own death. There are many factors that play a role in influencing whether someone decides to commit suicide. Nearly everyone experiences suicidal thoughts at one point or another throughout their existence. Everyone deals with tough times, but some people have been dealt a tougher hand when it comes to life circumstances, past trauma, mental and/or physical illness, social standing, and the ability to cope with depressive emotions.

## The tool used: Power BI

## Dataset Overview
I was provided with one dataset for this analysis. The dataset includes:

name of countries, sex. age, number of suicide, GDP per capita, number of suicide/100k, population, and generation.

## Data Preparation
I imported the datasets into Power BI Power Query for the transformation and validation of the data.

## Data Cleaning
* Changed data types of columns with incorrect data types.
* Removed unnecessary columns for easy analysis.
* Replaced null values with ‘0’

## Data Analysis
I analyzed the already-cleaned data to answer the following questions.

## 1. What is the generation with the highest suicide number?

The generation with the highest number of suicides is the boomer generation and it was observed that the boomer generation falls between the age bracket of 35- 54. at this age bracket, there are things common to this age group when it comes to the cause of suicide, some of them are personality disorders, PTSD, unemployment, depression, terminal diseases, and loneliness and this is more predominant in civilized societies among others.

even though boomer was dominant throughout the year nut as we filtered the data, we saw that older folks of 75+ commit suicide than other generations as we move down towards 2020.

## 2. which gender has the highest number of suicides?
Generally, the males gender has a number of suicide rate than the female counterpart but between 2017–2020 there was a sharp increase in females who committed suicide from 23% to around over 40%..but this doesn’t mean women are not attempting suicide more than men according to A study published in Industrial Psychiatric Journal in the year 2015 explored the ‘Gender differences among suicide attempters The study also implicated that the number of women who attempted suicide was more than men and the most common method they used was poisons or medication overdose.

But men, on the other hand, would usually go for lethal ways to end life. ‘There is this strong gender-based criterion of choosing the mode of suicide. It is often noticed that men will make sure that the mode they choose has zero means of saving themselves like they might jump off a cliff, hang themselves or take a more lethal way. But women are more subdued in selecting the method they might just cut their wrists or consume poison. It is seen that the modes that women use are less lethal and the survival chances are also more Generally the males gender has a number of suicide rate than the female counterpart but between 2017–2020 there was a sharp increase in females who committed suicide from 23 % to around over 40%..but this doesn’t mean we woman are not attempting suicide more than men according to A study published in Industrial Psychiatric Journal in the year 2015 explored the ‘Gender differences among suicide attempters The study also implicated that the number of women who attempted suicide was more than men and the most common method they used was poisons or medication overdose.

## 3. What is the country with the highest suicide rate?

Generally, Rusiia has the highest number of suicides, but Russia Ukaine the lead between 1990–1994, and between 2017–2020 USA topped the chart, despite being among the top three in terms of GDP per capita.

## 4. What are the yearly suicide trends among these countries?
In 2002 we have the highest suicide number compared to 2018 when we had the lowest but at the end of 2016 there was a spike in 2017 and there was a great drop in 2020. the countries that record suicide incidents were USA, Slovenia, Spain, and Singapore

## What is the yearly trend per/100k
Since 1985 we have had a steady increase in the number of suicide from over 6000 per 100k to 14600 in 1995 before a decline but it was sharp in 2015 and jumped down to 2000 per 100k but there was a little leap which still went down to 200 per 100k in 2020,

## 5. what are the relationship between population, GDP per capita, and suicide rate?

it's worthy of note to see that there is a correlation between GDPs per capita and the number of suicides rate of the top 10 countries, we saw that the countries with the highest rate of suicide are countries that were doing well economically mostly part of the top 10 with the highest GDPs per capita and also were countries with the top population.

## Recommendation
1. the research has shown that. the people or generation who are prone to committing suicide are older folks, in order to mitigate this we need to stay close to the older folks and make sure they are not lonely. loneliness can be a death sentence to some older people.
2. Many people try to get help before attempting suicide. In fact, studies indicate that more than 50 percent of suicide victims had sought medical help in the six months prior to their deaths. countries should have a system whereby those who lost their loved ones, or jobs, or have broken relationships or need such help can have access to mental health experts at no cost and accessible because this is how suicidal thoughts started if they are left unattended.
3. thirdly since men from the time past till now have the highest number of those who commit suicide i believe attention should be given to men regarding this. the reason can be seen in the research of prof hey also noted that, in men, the networks involved motor regions that are more associated with action, while the networks in women were dominated by brain regions that determine the emotional state of a person.
Prof Gopichshina Deshpande of Auburn University, USA conducted research, and part of the conclusions prof said: “This may support the fact that suicidal desire generally leads to decisive fatal action in males while in females, it manifests as depression, ideation, and generally non-fatal actions.”

4. lastly, there should be awareness that it's not a show of weakness for men to seek help, not being able to open up to people has led many men to commit suicide, creating such awareness and making a consultation for those who are seeking help for free and accessible will go a long way and in this regard, the government must be able to come in and support such initiatives.
