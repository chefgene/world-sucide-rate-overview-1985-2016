# WORLD SUCIDE RATE

## world sucide-rate overview 1985-2016

few days ago, I stumbled on a dataset on Kaggle on suicide rates over 113 countries and I decided to conduct an analysis to identify the ways to address the issue of suicide rates by the analysis of my data.

Suicide is defined as the act of intentionally causing one’s own death. There are many factors that play a role in influencing whether someone decides to commit suicide. Nearly everyone experiences suicidal thoughts at one point or another throughout their existence. Everyone deals with tough times, but some people have been dealt a tougher hand when it comes to life circumstances, past trauma, mental and/or physical illness, social standing, and the ability to cope with depressive emotions.

## The tool used: Power BI

## Dataset Overview
I was provided with one dataset for this analysis. The dataset includes:

name of countries, sex. age, number of suicide, GDP per capita, number of suicide/100k, population, and generation.

## Data Preparation
I imported the datasets into Power BI Power Query for the transformation and validation of the data.

## Data Cleaning
* Changed data types of columns with incorrect data types.
* Removed unnecessary columns for easy analysis.
* Replaced null values with ‘0’
* To ensure I work with the most recent and valid data, I filtered the table for data between 2014 and 2020. even though other past years were used to check the trends.

## Data Analysis
I analyzed the already-cleaned data to answer the following questions.

## 1. What is the generation with the highest suicide number?

The generation with the highest number of suicides is the boomer generation and it was observed that the boomer generation falls between the age bracket of 35- 54. at this age bracket, there are things common to this age group when it comes to the cause of suicide, some of them are personality disorders, PTSD, unemployment, depression, terminal diseases, and loneliness and this is more predominant in civilized societies among others.

even though boomer was dominant throughout the year nut as we filtered the data, we saw that older folks of 75+ commit suicide than other generations as we move down towards 2020.

## 2. which gender has the highest number of suicides?
Generally, the males gender has a number of suicide rate than the female counterpart but between 2017–2020 there was a sharp increase in females who committed suicide from 23% to around over 40%..but this doesn’t mean women are not attempting suicide more than men according to A study published in Industrial Psychiatric Journal in the year 2015 explored the ‘Gender differences among suicide attempters The study also implicated that the number of women who attempted suicide was more than men and the most common method they used was poisons or medication overdose.

But men, on the other hand, would usually go for lethal ways to end life. ‘There is this strong gender-based criterion of choosing the mode of suicide. It is often noticed that men will make sure that the mode they choose has zero means of saving themselves like they might jump off a cliff, hang themselves or take a more lethal way. But women are more subdued in selecting the method they might just cut their wrists or consume poison. It is seen that the modes that women use are less lethal and the survival chances are also more Generally the males gender has a number of suicide rate than the female counterpart but between 2017–2020 there was a sharp increase in females who committed suicide from 23 % to around over 40%..but this doesn’t mean we woman are not attempting suicide more than men according to A study published in Industrial Psychiatric Journal in the year 2015 explored the ‘Gender differences among suicide attempters The study also implicated that the number of women who attempted suicide was more than men and the most common method they used was poisons or medication overdose.

## 3. What is the country with the highest suicide rate?

Generally, Ukraine has the highest number of suicides, but Russia took the lead between 1990–1994, and between 2017–2020 USA topped the chart despite being among the top three in terms of GDP per capita.
